Sheweth

That your memorialist has the honour of submitting his claims against the Republic, to Your Excellency under date of the llth november 1818, and no part of which having been paid, they are considerably increased, as will be seen by the following statement:

Pay from 4th september 1818 to Ist May 1820546 tons at 23 s per ton per month - 20 months a L 62718 per month: 12,558-5% thereon: 62718 13,185-18- O

20 months Interest on L 7,886-15-3 amount of arras, etc, which by agreement was to have been paid on arrival, a 1 per cent per month, ot Ist May 1820 (former Interest admitted in the first item)  1,576-6-8

30 months Interest (to Ist May 1820) thereon, a 1

per cent per month 72-16- O

Interest thereon from 5th February 1819 to Ist May

1820 at 1% per month 5,150- 1- 3

Making together sterling L 78,948- 2-11

Your memorialist begs to state to Your Excellency that the price agreed upon by the Representative in London for the Libertador and cargo amounted as above to the sum of L 34,333-16, subject to a deduction if the goods were not delivered in sound condition; infortunately a proportion was found to be damaged on arrival at Margarita, and the large sum of L 6,549-14-7 was taken from the invoice, in consequence of the above clause in the agreement, and one half per cent per month interest was only stipulated to be allowed upon the invoice when the current rate is 1 p/ cent p/ month Your memorialist humbly submits to Your Excellency that although the deduction and rate of interest was agreed to by his supercargo (the latter from his want of better knowledge) that the present account for the Libertador may be admitted by Your Excellency, otherwise Your memorialist wili lose considerably; and this never was the intention nor the spirit of the agreement Although your memorialist has suffered dreadfully by the want of punctuality in fullfiling the contracts in question, and is still labouring under great difficulties from having embarked the whole of his fortune in the glorious cause of Independence, yet he has been unwilling to trouble Your Excellency since the date of his last memorial, November llth 1818, well knowing from the Representatives in London the situation of the Republic until now, when by the bravery and wisdom of Your Excellency, Columbia is placed in a situation to discharge the contracts; your memorialist, therefore trusts that the present application will be immediately taken into serious consideration and the amount paid to his supercargo, Mr John Dixon

Your memorialist is unwilling to trespass further upon the valuable time of Your Excellency in pointing out the zeal he has shewn, and the exertions he is still making to contribute towards the Independence and welfare of Columbia, but refers to His Excellency F de Penalver

Your memorialist begs to subscribe himself with the highest regards for Your Excellency

Your Excellency’s most obedient and humble servant Newcastle on Tyne, 25 march 1820

Edward Hall Campbell

Cuartel General de San Cayetano, agosto 10 de 1820
